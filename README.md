# Adaptive Resource Allocation System Using Machine Learning

This project dynamically optimizes CPU and memory resource allocation in multiprogramming systems using machine learning. It collects real-time process data, analyzes key performance metrics, and predicts optimal resource distribution to improve system efficiency.

## Features
- Real-time data collection for CPU and memory metrics
- Automatic logging of process behavior for ML model training
- Efficient tracking of key resource parameters such as CPU usage, memory consumption, context switches, and more
- Designed for cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Customizable data collection interval for improved flexibility
