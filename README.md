# Dynamic Resource Allocation System in multi programming systems
## Introduction

The Adaptive Resource Allocation System leverages machine learning to optimize CPU and memory distribution in multiprogramming environments. By continuously monitoring process behavior and system performance, it predicts and reallocates resources in real-time to prevent bottlenecks and improve efficiency. This solution ensures balanced resource utilization, enhancing system stability and responsiveness in dynamic workloads.

##Introduction
Multiprogramming systems are operating systems that allow multiple programs to run concurrently on a single processor by switching between them when one program needs to wait for an input/output operation, thus maximizing CPU utilization. Unlike single-program systems, multiprogramming systems can have multiple programs loaded into memory and ready to run, but only one program is actively executing at any given time. In a multiprogramming system, resource allocation involves the operating system efficiently distributing computing resources (like CPU, memory, and I/O devices) among multiple processes to maximize system throughput and utilization. 
In a multiprogramming environment, resources are often scarce, and the operating system must make strategic decisions about how to allocate them to different processes to ensure efficient and fair usage. ## Introduction

Modern multiprogramming systems frequently face resource contention, where multiple processes compete for limited CPU and memory resources. Static resource allocation strategies often struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads, resulting in performance bottlenecks, increased latency, and inefficient resource utilization.  In high-demand environments, some processes may receive excessive resources while others starve, causing system instability and degraded performance. Traditional methods like fixed priority scheduling or round-robin allocation may fail to handle unpredictable spikes in resource usage.  To address this, our project leverages machine learning to create an **Adaptive Resource Allocation System** that dynamically distributes CPU and memory resources based on real-time system metrics. By continuously monitoring process behavior and identifying patterns, the system can make intelligent decisions to improve performance, prevent bottlenecks, and enhance overall system stability.  This approach aims to balance responsiveness, fairness, and efficiency, making it ideal for modern operating systems where resource demand is constantly changing.
